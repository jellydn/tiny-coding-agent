## 2026-01-20 22:50 - US-001
- Session: https://opncd.ai/s/abc123
- Implemented Header component in `src/ui/components/Header.tsx`
- Exports: Header component with model prop
- Features: Agent name with emoji, model display on right side, cyan border style
- Updated `src/ui/components/index.ts` to export new Header component
- Typecheck: pass, Lint: pass, Test: pass (241 tests), Format: pass

**Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use Ink's Box with flexDirection="row" and justifyContent="space-between" for header layout
  - HeaderBox.tsx shows a similar pattern that could be consolidated
  - Export types alongside components from index files
  - Commit triggered pre-commit hook with lint and format checks
