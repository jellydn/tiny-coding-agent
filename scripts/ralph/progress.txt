## Codebase Patterns
- tsconfig.json already configured with `jsx: react-jsx` - no changes needed for JSX support
- Use `src/ui/` for all Ink/React components, `src/ui/components/` for reusable UI pieces
- Ink v6 uses React 19 - use functional components with proper React.ReactElement return types

- Installed ink@6.6.0, react@19.2.3, @types/react@19.2.8
- Created src/ui/App.tsx with basic App component and renderApp helper
- Created src/ui/components/ directory for future components
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - tsconfig already had `jsx: react-jsx` configured from project setup
  - Ink v6 is the latest version, works with React 19
  - App component exports both the component and a renderApp() helper for easy rendering
