## Sat Jan 24 2026 - US-001
- Session: https://opncd.ai/s/Demo
- Implemented skills types and directory structure
- Created src/skills/types.ts with SkillMetadata, SkillFrontmatter, Skill interfaces
- Created src/skills/index.ts exporting all types
- Files changed:
  - src/skills/types.ts (new)
  - src/skills/index.ts (new)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeScript interfaces use PascalCase naming convention
  - Exports should be re-exported from index.ts using type modifier for clarity
  - Always run typecheck and lint before committing
  - This codebase uses .js extension in imports even for TypeScript files

## Sat Jan 24 2026 - US-002
- Session: https://opncd.ai/s/Demo
- Implemented SKILL.md frontmatter parser
- Created src/skills/parser.ts with parseSkillFrontmatter function
- Created src/skills/parser.test.ts with 18 comprehensive tests
- Updated src/skills/index.ts to export parser functions
- Files changed:
  - src/skills/parser.ts (new)
  - src/skills/parser.test.ts (new)
  - src/skills/index.ts (updated exports)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `!("field" in parsed)` to check if field exists before checking its value
  - Empty strings are falsy in JavaScript, so `!parsed.field` catches both undefined and ""
  - The yaml package is available in this project for parsing YAML content
  - Body content after --- may have leading newline that needs trimming
  - Always run format (oxfmt) before committing as it's enforced by husky pre-commit
