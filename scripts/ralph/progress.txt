## Sat Jan 24 2026 - US-001
- Session: https://opncd.ai/s/Demo
- Implemented skills types and directory structure
- Created src/skills/types.ts with SkillMetadata, SkillFrontmatter, Skill interfaces
- Created src/skills/index.ts exporting all types
- Files changed:
  - src/skills/types.ts (new)
  - src/skills/index.ts (new)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeScript interfaces use PascalCase naming convention
  - Exports should be re-exported from index.ts using type modifier for clarity
  - Always run typecheck and lint before committing
  - This codebase uses .js extension in imports even for TypeScript files

## Sat Jan 24 2026 - US-002
- Session: https://opncd.ai/s/Demo
- Implemented SKILL.md frontmatter parser
- Created src/skills/parser.ts with parseSkillFrontmatter function
- Created src/skills/parser.test.ts with 18 comprehensive tests
- Updated src/skills/index.ts to export parser functions
- Files changed:
  - src/skills/parser.ts (new)
  - src/skills/parser.test.ts (new)
  - src/skills/index.ts (updated exports)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `!("field" in parsed)` to check if field exists before checking its value
  - Empty strings are falsy in JavaScript, so `!parsed.field` catches both undefined and ""
  - The yaml package is available in this project for parsing YAML content
  - Body content after --- may have leading newline that needs trimming
  - Always run format (oxfmt) before committing as it's enforced by husky pre-commit
---

## Sat Jan 24 2026 - US-003
- Session: https://opncd.ai/s/Demo
- Implemented skill discovery from directories
- Created src/skills/loader.ts with discoverSkills(directories) function
- Created src/skills/loader.test.ts with 10 comprehensive tests
- Updated src/skills/index.ts to export discoverSkills function
- Files changed:
  - src/skills/loader.ts (new)
  - src/skills/loader.test.ts (new)
  - src/skills/index.ts (updated exports)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `path.resolve()` to handle relative paths safely
  - Use `fs.promises.readdir()` with `withFileTypes: true` for efficient directory traversal
  - Recursive directory scanning needs to pass array by reference to accumulate results
  - Use non-null assertion `!` when accessing array elements after length check
  - Graceful error handling: use try-catch and continue rather than throw for expected failures

## Sat Jan 24 2026 - US-004
- Session: https://opncd.ai/s/Demo
- Implemented generateSkillsPrompt function for XML output
- Created src/skills/prompt.ts with generateSkillsPrompt(skills) function

- Files changed:
  - src/skills/prompt.ts (new)
  - src/skills/prompt.test.ts (new)
  - src/skills/index.ts (updated exports)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - XML string construction can use template literals directly for simple cases
  - When generating XML, no special escaping needed for basic skill metadata

## Sat Jan 24 2026 - US-005
- Session: https://opncd.ai/s/Demo
- Implemented skill activation tool
- Created src/tools/skill-tool.ts with createSkillTool factory function
- Created src/tools/skill-tool.test.ts with 6 comprehensive tests
- Updated src/tools/index.ts to export createSkillTool
- Files changed:
  - src/tools/skill-tool.ts (new)
  - src/tools/skill-tool.test.ts (new)
  - src/tools/index.ts (updated exports)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use factory function pattern to inject skillRegistry into tool via closure
  - Wrap skill content in XML tags with name and base_dir attributes for context
  - Include available skills list in error messages for better developer experience
  - Error messages should include helpful context (like available skills) when appropriate


## Sat Jan 24 2026 - US-006
- Session: https://opncd.ai/s/Demo
- Implemented skills configuration to config schema
- Added skillDirectories?: string[] to Config interface
- Added validation for optional array of strings in validateConfig
- Added default directories ['~/.tiny-agent/skills/', './.skills/'] in getDefaultConfig
- Added ~ to homedir() expansion in loadConfig for skillDirectories
- Files changed:
  - src/config/schema.ts (added skillDirectories property and validation)
  - src/config/loader.ts (added default directories and ~ expansion)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use Array.isArray() to validate array types in config validation
  - When expanding ~ to homedir, use path.join(homedir(), dir.slice(2)) for paths starting with ~/
  - Run format (oxfmt) before committing as it's enforced by husky pre-commit

## Sat Jan 24 2026 - US-007
- Session: https://opncd.ai/s/Demo
- Implemented skills integration into Agent class
- Added skillDirectories option to AgentOptions interface
- Added _skills Map and _skillsInitialized flag as private fields
- Added _initializeSkills private async method for lazy skill loading
- Modified constructor to trigger skills discovery via _skillsInitPromise
- Updated runStream to await skills initialization before processing
- Added getSkillRegistry() public method for skill tool access
- Files changed:
  - src/core/agent.ts (added skills support)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Constructors cannot be async in TypeScript; use lazy initialization with promises
  - Use a private promise field to track async initialization without blocking constructor
  - Await the initialization promise at the start of runStream or other entry points
  - The _skills Map provides the registry for skill tool access via getSkillRegistry()

## Sat Jan 24 2026 - US-008
- Session: https://opncd.ai/s/Demo
- Implemented skill tool registration and CLI wiring
- Added createSkillTool import to main.tsx
- Updated handleRun to pass config.skillDirectories to Agent constructor
- Updated handleRun to create and register skill tool with agent's skill registry
- Updated handleInteractiveChat with same changes
- Files changed:
  - src/cli/main.tsx (added skill tool registration)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Skill tool needs agent's skill registry, so must be created after agent instantiation
  - Pattern: create agent first, then get registry, create tool, register tool
  - Both handleRun and handleInteractiveChat need the same skill tool registration pattern

## Sat Jan 24 2026 - US-009
- Session: https://opncd.ai/s/Demo
- Implemented skill list CLI command
- Added handleSkill function to main.tsx
- Updated main() to handle 'skill' command
- Updated help text to include skill commands
- Added dynamic import of discoverSkills in handleSkill
- Files changed:
  - src/cli/main.tsx (added skill command handling)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use dynamic imports for modules that may not be needed in all execution paths
  - Follow the same pattern as handleMemory for consistency
  - Truncate description to 60 chars for list view

## Sat Jan 24 2026 - US-010
- Session: https://opncd.ai/s/Demo
- Implemented skill show CLI command
- Added 'show' subcommand handling in handleSkill function
- Supports --json flag for JSON output with name, description, body fields
- Shows error if skill not found with list of available skills
- Reads and displays full SKILL.md content
- Files changed:
  - src/cli/main.tsx (added skill show command)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use dynamic imports for fs module when only needed for specific subcommands
  - Provide helpful error messages with available options when skill not found
  - JSON output format should match acceptance criteria exactly
